# cats_vs_dogs
In this task, I implemeneted a neural network to classify wether an image contains a dog or cat. 
In the first try, I implemented the VGG16 architecture from scratch and trained it. But i realized that using a pretrained VGG16 architecture(transfer learning) leads to better performance.
