In this project, I implemented an MLP model with pytorch framework for a multi-class classification task. Then I experimented with various settings and analysed the effects of various settings in order to come up with the best setupt, my experimentations included:
1. Effects of various weight initialization methods.
2. Effetcs of various loss functions.
3. Effets of various number of layers and neurons.
4. Implementing data augmentation techniques and drop out layers to prevent overfitting.
5. Fine-Tuning hyper-parameters.
